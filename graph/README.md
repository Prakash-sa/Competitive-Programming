- BFS only works for unweighted graphs. For weighted graphs, we'll need Dijkstra's algorithm.
- For negative edge cycles, we need Bellman-Ford's algorithm. Again this algorithm is single source
shortest path algorithm. 
- If we need to find out distance from each nodes to all other nodes, we'll need Floyd-
Warshall's algorithm.
