'''
Implement a first in first out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks. The implemented queue should support all the functions of a normal queue (push, peek, pop, and empty).
Implement the MyQueue class:

void push(int x) Pushes element x to the back of the queue.
int pop() Removes the element from the front of the queue and returns it.
int peek() Returns the element at the front of the queue.
boolean empty() Returns true if the queue is empty, false otherwise.
Notes:
You must use only standard operations of a stack, which means only push to top, peek/pop from top, size, and is empty operations are valid.
Depending on your language, the stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a stack's standard operations.

Example 1:
Input
["MyQueue", "push", "push", "peek", "pop", "empty"]
[[], [1], [2], [], [], []]
Output
[null, null, null, 1, 1, false]
Explanation
MyQueue myQueue = new MyQueue();
myQueue.push(1); // queue is: [1]
myQueue.push(2); // queue is: [1, 2] (leftmost is front of the queue)
myQueue.peek(); // return 1
myQueue.pop(); // return 1, queue is [2]
myQueue.empty(); // return false

Constraints:
1 <= x <= 9
At most 100 calls will be made to push, pop, peek, and empty.
All the calls to pop and peek are valid.

Follow-up: Can you implement the queue such that each operation is amortized O(1) time complexity? In other words, performing n operations will take overall O(n) time even if one of those operations may take longer.

class MyQueue:

    def __init__(self):
        self.in_stack=[] # Stores elements that are enqueued
        self.out_stack=[] # Stores elements that are dequeued

    def push(self, x: int) -> None:
        self.in_stack.append(x)
    
    def _transfer(self):
        if not self.out_stack:
            while self.in_stack:
                self.out_stack.append(self.in_stack.pop())

    def pop(self) -> int:
        self._transfer()
        return self.out_stack.pop()

    def peek(self) -> int:
        self._transfer()
        return self.out_stack[-1]

    def empty(self) -> bool:
        return not self.in_stack and not self.out_stack


# Your MyQueue object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = MyQueue()
# obj.push(x)
# param_2 = obj.pop()
# param_3 = obj.peek()
# param_4 = obj.empty()

# Use two stacks with lazy transfer.
# Amortized O(1) time per operation and O(n) space.

'''
The application for this implementation is to separate read & write of a queue in multi-processing. 
One of the stack is for read, and another is for write. 
They only interfere each other when the former one is full or latter is empty.
