1. I was learning how to implement Generative AI projects and followed this AWS workshop: Semantic Search Workshop(https://catalog.workshops.aws/semantic-search/en-US/module-8-conversational-search). While exploring the hands-on labs, I mistakenly left some resources running longer than intended. I believed I had deleted everything afterward, but it appears some services—such as SageMaker and Lambda—continued to incur charges.

2. I was laid off in May and have been focusing on upskilling myself by learning new GenAI tools and preparing for job interviews. As an international student on an OPT visa, I had a limited time window (five months) to secure a new position before my visa expired. Due to this situation, I was fully focused on job applications and interview preparation and didn’t notice the ongoing AWS billing issue until recently.

3. Could you please confirm the maximum amount that can be waived for this case? I understand the total charges are significant, but I would deeply appreciate any assistance AWS can provide at this difficult time.
