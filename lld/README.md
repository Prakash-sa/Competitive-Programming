# LLD (Low-Level Design)

This folder contains concise explanations and examples of core object-oriented design concepts used in low-level design (LLD). The goal is to provide quick reference notes and small code examples to help with interviews and study.

Contents

- Introduction files:
  - `introduction/Abstraction.md` — Abstraction: exposing a simple interface and hiding implementation.
  - `introduction/Encapsulation.md` — Encapsulation: controlling access to data and implementation details.
  - `introduction/Inheritance.md` — Inheritance: modelling IS-A relationships between classes.
  - `introduction/Polymorphism.md` — Polymorphism: compile-time (overloading) and runtime (overriding) polymorphism.

Key concepts covered

- Attributes, methods, classes, and objects
- Principles of OOP: Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism
