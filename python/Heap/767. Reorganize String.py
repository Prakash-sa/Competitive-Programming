'''
Given a string s, rearrange the characters of s so that any two adjacent characters are not the same.
Return any possible rearrangement of s or return "" if not possible.

Example 1:
Input: s = "aab"
Output: "aba"
Example 2:
Input: s = "aaab"
Output: ""

Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 500
s consists of lowercase English letters.

# Complexity Analysis
# Let N be the total characters in the string.
# Let k be the total unique characters in the string.

# Time complexity: O(Nâ‹…logk). We add one character to the string per iteration, so there are O(N) iterations. In each iteration, we perform a maximum of 3 priority queue operations. Each priority queue operation costs logk. For this problem, k is bounded by 26, so one could argue that the time complexity is actually O(N).

# Space complexity: O(k). The counter used to count the number of occurrences will incur a space complexity of O(k). Similarly, the maximum size of the priority queue will also be O(k). Given that k <= 26 in this problem, one could argue the space complexity is O(1).
