'''
Given an integer array of size n, find all elements that appear more than ⌊ n/3 ⌋ times. 

Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: [3]
Example 2:
Input: nums = [1]
Output: [1]
Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,2]
Output: [1,2]
 
Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109

Follow up: Could you solve the problem in linear time and in O(1) space?

# Approach 1: Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm
# Intuition

# To figure out a O(1) space requirement, we would need to get this simple intuition first. For an array of length n:

# There can be at most one majority element which is more than ⌊n/2⌋ times.
# There can be at most two majority elements which are more than ⌊n/3⌋ times.
# There can be at most three majority elements which are more than ⌊n/4⌋ times.

# Complexity Analysis

# Time complexity : O(N) where N is the size of nums. We first go through nums looking for first and second potential candidates. We then count the number of occurrences for these two potential candidates in nums. Therefore, our runtime is O(N)+O(N)=O(2N)≈O(N).

# Space complexity : O(1) since we only have four variables for holding two potential candidates and two counters. Even the returning array is at most 2 elements.
