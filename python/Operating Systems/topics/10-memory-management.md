# Memory Management Basics

## Logical vs Physical Address Space
- **Logical (virtual) address:** generated by CPU.
- **Physical address:** actual location in RAM; MMU translates logical → physical.

## Allocation Schemes
| Scheme | Description | Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fixed partitions | RAM divided into fixed blocks | Simple, little bookkeeping | Internal fragmentation |
| Variable partitions | Allocate exactly requested size | Better utilization | External fragmentation, compaction needed |
| Buddy system | Power-of-two blocks split/merged | Fast allocation/merge | Internal fragmentation when request not power-of-two |

## Allocation Strategies
- First-fit, best-fit, worst-fit, next-fit. Compare average search times and fragmentation side effects.

## Swapping
Entire process moved to backing store, freeing RAM; modern OS swap individual pages.

## Relocation & Protection
Base and limit registers enforce per-process address bounds; relocation performed either statically (link-time) or dynamically (run-time via MMU).

## Fragmentation Types
- **Internal:** unused space inside allocated region (e.g., last page not filled).
- **External:** total free memory exists but not contiguous.

## Study Prompts
- Illustrate external fragmentation after sequence of allocate/free operations.
- Distinguish segmentation fault vs page fault.
