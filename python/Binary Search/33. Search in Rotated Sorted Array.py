'''
There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).
Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly left rotated at an unknown index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be left rotated by 3 indices and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].
Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
Example 2:
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
Example 3:
Input: nums = [1], target = 0
Output: -1
 

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 5000
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
All values of nums are unique.
nums is an ascending array that is possibly rotated.
-104 <= target <= 104

class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        left=0
        right=len(nums)-1

        while left<=right:
            mid=(left+right)//2

            if nums[mid]==target:
                return mid
            
            if nums[left]<=nums[mid]:
                if nums[left]<=target and target<nums[mid]:
                    right=mid-1
                else:
                    left=mid+1
            else:
                if nums[mid]<target and target<=nums[right]:
                    left=mid+1
                else:
                    right=mid-1
        return -1
        
# Time Complexity: O(log n) where n is the number of elements in the array. We are reducing the search space by half in each iteration, just like we do in classic binary search.

# Space Complexity: O(1) We are using a constant amount of space.
