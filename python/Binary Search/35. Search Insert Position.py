'''
Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
Output: 2
Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 2
Output: 1
Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 7
Output: 4

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 104
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
nums contains distinct values sorted in ascending order.
-104 <= target <= 104

class Solution:
    def searchInsert(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
        while left <= right:
            pivot = (left + right) // 2
            if nums[pivot] == target:
                return pivot
            if target < nums[pivot]:
                right = pivot - 1
            else:
                left = pivot + 1
        return left
    
# Complexity Analysis
# Time complexity : O(logN).
# Let us compute the time complexity with the help of master theorem

# Space complexity: O(1)
# since it's a constant space solution.
