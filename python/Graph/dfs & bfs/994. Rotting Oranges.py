# https://leetcode.com/problems/rotting-oranges/description/

'''
You are given an m x n grid where each cell can have one of three values:
0 representing an empty cell,
1 representing a fresh orange, or
2 representing a rotten orange.
Every minute, any fresh orange that is 4-directionally adjacent to a rotten orange becomes rotten.
Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange. If this is impossible, return -1.

 

Example 1:
Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]
Output: 4
Example 2:
Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,1]]
Output: -1
Explanation: The orange in the bottom left corner (row 2, column 0) is never rotten, because rotting only happens 4-directionally.
Example 3:
Input: grid = [[0,2]]
Output: 0
Explanation: Since there are already no fresh oranges at minute 0, the answer is just 0.
 

Constraints:
m == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 10
grid[i][j] is 0, 1, or 2.

# Complexity Analysis:
# Time Complexity: O(NM), where NÃ—M is the size of the grid.
# First, we scan the grid to find the initial values for the queue, which would take O(NM) time.
# Then we run the BFS process on the queue, which in the worst case would enumerate all the cells in the grid once and only once. 
# Therefore, it takes O(NM) time.
# Thus combining the above two steps, the overall time complexity would be O(NM)+O(NM)=O(NM)

# Space Complexity: O(NM), where N is the size of the grid.
# In the worst case, the grid is filled with rotten oranges. As a result, the queue would be initialized with all the cells in the grid.
# By the way, normally for BFS, the main space complexity lies in the process rather than the initialization. 
# For instance, for a BFS traversal in a tree, at any given moment, the queue would hold no more than 2 levels of tree nodes. 
# Therefore, the space complexity of BFS traversal in a tree would depend on the width of the input tree.
