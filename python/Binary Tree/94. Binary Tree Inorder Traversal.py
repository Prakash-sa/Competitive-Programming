'''
Given the root of a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values. 

Example 1:
Input: root = [1,null,2,3]
Output: [1,3,2]
Explanation:

Example 2:
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,8,null,null,6,7,9]
Output: [4,2,6,5,7,1,3,9,8]
Explanation:

Example 3:
Input: root = []
Output: []

Example 4:
Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
 
Follow up: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?

# Complexity Analysis
# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(n)


# Approach 3: Morris Traversal
# In this method, we have to use a new data structure - Threaded Binary Tree, and the strategy is as follows:

# Step 1: Initialize current as root

# Step 2: While current is not NULL,

# If current does not have left child

#     a. Add currentâ€™s value

#     b. Go to the right, i.e., current = current.right

# Else

#     a. In current's left subtree, make current the right child of the rightmost node

#     b. Go to this left child, i.e., current = current.left
