# https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/description/

'''
Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).
A valid BST is defined as follows:
The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys strictly less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys strictly greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees. 

Example 1:
Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: root = [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]
Output: false
Explanation: The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4.
 

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
-231 <= Node.val <= 231 - 1

# Complexity Analysis:
# Time complexity: O(N) since we visit each node exactly once.
# Space complexity: O(N) since we keep up to the entire tree.
