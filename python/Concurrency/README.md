# Notes


- race conditions: the program ends with an undesired output, resulting from the sequence of execution among the processes.
- deadlocks: the concurrent processes wait for some necessary resources from each other. As a result, none of them can make progress.
- resource starvation: a process is perpetually denied necessary resources to progress its works.
